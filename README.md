Simple game to demonstrate coding style

The Bee Game 

Objective: 
The objective of this exercise is to create an Android application that performs the following tasks:

	•	A screen must be produced as the interface to play the game. Styling is not expected nor necessary.  
	•	A button must be present to kick off the process of hitting a random bee. 
	•	All code must be submitted to work in a local environment.
	•	The game must adhere to the following rules and constraints. 

Specification: 
Bees: 
There are three types of bees in this game:  

	•	Queen Bee:
	•	The Queen Bee has a lifespan of 100 Hit Points.  
	•	When the Queen Bee is hit, 8 Hit Points are deducted from her lifespan. 
	•	If/When the Queen Bee has run out of Hit Points, All remaining alive Bees automatically run out of hit points.  
	•	There is only 1 Queen Bee.  

	•	Worker Bee:
	•	Worker Bees have a lifespan of 75 Hit Points.  
	•	When a Worker Bee is hit, 10 Hit Points are deducted from his lifespan.  
	•	There are 5 Worker Bees.  

	•	Drone Bee:
	•	Drone Bees have a lifespan of 50 Hit Points.  
	•	When a Drone Bee is hit, 12 Hit Points are deducted from his lifespan.  
	•	There are 8 Drone Bees. 

Gameplay:
 To play, there must be a button that enables a user to “hit” a random bee. The selection of a bee must be random. When the bees are all dead, the game must be able to reset itself with full life bees for another round. 

Constraints:
All code must be unit tested.
